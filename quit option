# adding ask_or_quit to inputs checks to see if the user typed 'quit' for their input, and then exits the game if they did.
# example: guess = ask_or_quit('Take a guess! ')...

# place at beginning of program; I saw this is already part of game.py
import sys

def ask_or_quit(message):
  ans = input(message)
  if ans.upper() == 'QUIT':
    # SystemExit raises an exception (exception fixed below). 
    sys.exit('Thanks for playing!')
  
  return ans

# place at end of program
# fixes exit message
except SystemExit: 
  print('Thanks for playing!')
